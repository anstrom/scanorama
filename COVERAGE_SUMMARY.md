# Go Pipeline Test Coverage - Executive Summary

**Date:** September 6, 2025  
**Current Overall Coverage:** 46.4%  
**Target Threshold:** 50%  
**Status:** 🔴 Below Target

## Quick Stats

| Status | Count | Modules |
|--------|-------|---------|
| 🟢 Excellent (≥80%) | 3 | logging, workers, api |
| 🟢 Good (60-79%) | 2 | config, errors |
| 🟡 Moderate (40-59%) | 1 | discovery |
| 🔴 Poor (20-39%) | 2 | scanning, daemon |
| 🔥 Critical (<20%) | 2 | **auth, db** |

## Critical Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Missing Dependencies** - Added Prometheus client library
2. **Build Conflicts** - Resolved duplicate function declarations
3. **Performance Issues** - Fixed infinite loops in test suite
4. **Schema Mismatches** - Updated code to match database schema

## Immediate Action Items (This Week)

### 1. Address Critical Modules 🔥
```bash
# Database module (15.7% → 60%)
make db-setup
go test ./internal/db -v -coverprofile=db_coverage.out
make db-teardown

# Auth module (18.3% → 60%)  
go test ./internal/auth -v -run=TestJWT
go test ./internal/auth -v -run=TestAPIKey
```

### 2. Quick Coverage Wins 📈
- **Scanning module**: Add mock network tests (+15%)
- **Daemon module**: Add service lifecycle tests (+20%)
- **Discovery module**: Add error path tests (+10%)

### 3. Test Infrastructure Setup 🛠️
```bash
# Run coverage check
./scripts/coverage-check.sh

# Setup test database
make setup-dev-db

# Generate coverage report
make coverage-core
```

## Weekly Goals

| Week | Target | Focus Areas |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Week 1 | 50% | Critical modules (db, auth) |
| Week 2 | 55% | Poor modules (scanning, daemon) |
| Week 3 | 60% | Integration tests |
| Week 4 | 65% | Edge cases & error paths |

## Resources Created 📁

- `COVERAGE_INVESTIGATION.md` - Detailed analysis report
- `scripts/coverage-check.sh` - Automated coverage analysis
- `coverage-reports/` - HTML coverage reports
- `coverage-reports/improvement_plan_*.sh` - Auto-generated action items

## Key Commands

```bash
# Daily coverage check
./scripts/coverage-check.sh

# Module-specific testing
make test-core                    # Fast tests, no DB
make test DB_HOST=localhost       # Full test suite
make coverage                     # Generate HTML reports

# CI pipeline simulation
make ci-quick                     # Quality + unit tests
make ci-all                       # Full pipeline
```

## Success Metrics 📊

- **Coverage Trend**: +2% per week
- **Module Health**: All modules >20% by Week 2
- **CI Stability**: <5% flaky test rate
- **Performance**: Tests complete <2 minutes

## Next Review: September 13, 2025

**Meeting Agenda:**
1. Review week 1 progress
2. Assess critical module improvements  
3. Plan integration test strategy
4. Set CI coverage gates

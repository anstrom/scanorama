## ‚úÖ Recently Resolved Issues

### Discovery Engine Privilege Issues (RESOLVED) 
**Issue**: Discovery engine failing in CI due to ICMP ping requiring root privileges
**Resolution**: Successfully transitioned to TCP-based host discovery
- Replaced `nmap.WithPingScan()` with TCP connect discovery using common ports (22,80,443,8080,8443,3389,5432,6379)
- Updated `buildNmapOptions()` to use `nmap.WithConnectScan()` instead of ICMP ping
- All discovery functionality now works without requiring elevated privileges
- Maintained full host discovery capability while being CI-compatible

**Impact**: Discovery engine now works reliably in CI environments without root privileges

### CI System Stability (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Persistent test failures in CI environment due to database race conditions
**Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive transaction-safe operations and enhanced consistency checks
- Added transaction-safe host lookup with retries
- Enhanced discovery completion verification with database consistency checks
- Implemented foreign key validation to prevent constraint violations
- Added comprehensive debugging and extended timeouts for CI reliability
- Fixed race conditions between discovery and scan operations

**Impact**: All integration tests now pass consistently in CI environment

### Code Quality Issues (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Multiple linting violations affecting code quality standards  
**Resolution**: Fixed all remaining linting issues
- Added scan type constants (`scanTypeConnect`, `scanTypeVersion`, etc.) for repeated string literals
- Simplified complex nested blocks to reduce cyclomatic complexity by extracting helper functions
- Fixed line length violations and function complexity issues
- Maintained zero linting issues standard

**Impact**: Codebase now maintains 0 linting issues with clean, maintainable code

## ‚úÖ Recently Resolved Issues (Latest)

### Atomic Scan Operations & Hostname Resolution (RESOLVED)
**Issue**: Race condition causing "scan job no longer exists before port scan creation" and hostname CIDR conversion failures
**Resolution**: Implemented comprehensive atomic scan operations and hostname resolution
- Fixed hostname to CIDR conversion by implementing proper DNS resolution before network creation
- Enhanced transaction-safe scan operations with proper error handling
- Added helper functions (`resolveTargetToNetwork`, `resolveHostnameToNetwork`, `ipToNetworkString`) to reduce complexity
- Fixed "invalid CIDR notation" errors when scanning hostnames like localhost

**Impact**: All scan operations now work reliably with both IP addresses and hostnames, preventing foreign key constraint violations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

### 1. Profile Array Scanning Issue  
**Status**: Identified but not yet resolved
**Impact**: `./scanorama profiles list` fails with PostgreSQL array scanning error
**Workaround**: Profiles are created in database but cannot be displayed via CLI
**Solution**: Need to properly handle `pq.StringArray` types in Go scanning

### 2. Schedule Command Argument Parsing
**Status**: Argument count validation issue
**Impact**: `./scanorama schedule add-discovery` fails with usage error
**Workaround**: Can create scheduled jobs programmatically
**Solution**: Fix argument parsing logic in schedule commands

### 3. Database Test Timeouts in CI Environment
**Status**: Intermittent issue affecting CI reliability
**Impact**: Database tests occasionally timeout in CI while trying to connect to multiple database configurations

## üìù Code Quality & Development Workflow

### Linting Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Always run linting after every code change to maintain code quality standards.

```bash
# Run linting after any code changes
make lint

# Alternative: Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix

# Complete pre-commit checks (recommended)
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```

### Development Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Always run `make lint` after code changes** - this is mandatory
- ‚úÖ Use `make ci-local` for comprehensive checks before pushing
- ‚úÖ Run `./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` before committing
- ‚úÖ Fix all linting issues immediately - don't accumulate technical debt
- ‚úÖ Current status: **0 linting issues** (keep it this way!)

### Recent Lint Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ Fixed `goconst` issue by creating `nullValue` constant for repeated "NULL" strings
- ‚úÖ All line length violations resolved
- ‚úÖ All code complexity issues addressed
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling implemented throughout

### Git Workflow Integration
```bash
# Recommended workflow for any code change:
1. Make your changes
2. make lint          # Fix any issues immediately
3. make test          # Ensure tests pass
4. ./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh  # Final verification
5. git commit         # Only after all checks pass
```

## üß™ Testing

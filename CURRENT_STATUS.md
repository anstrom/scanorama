## üìù Code Quality & Development Workflow

### Linting Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Always run linting after every code change to maintain code quality standards.

```bash
# Run linting after any code changes
make lint

# Alternative: Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix

# Complete pre-commit checks (recommended)
./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh
```

### Development Best Practices
- ‚úÖ **Always run `make lint` after code changes** - this is mandatory
- ‚úÖ Use `make ci-local` for comprehensive checks before pushing
- ‚úÖ Run `./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh` before committing
- ‚úÖ Fix all linting issues immediately - don't accumulate technical debt
- ‚úÖ Current status: **0 linting issues** (keep it this way!)

### Recent Lint Fixes Applied
- ‚úÖ Fixed `goconst` issue by creating `nullValue` constant for repeated "NULL" strings
- ‚úÖ All line length violations resolved
- ‚úÖ All code complexity issues addressed
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling implemented throughout

### Git Workflow Integration
```bash
# Recommended workflow for any code change:
1. Make your changes
2. make lint          # Fix any issues immediately
3. make test          # Ensure tests pass
4. ./scripts/pre-commit-check.sh  # Final verification
5. git commit         # Only after all checks pass
```

## üß™ Testing

### Run Full Test Suite
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
make ci-local

# Run specific tests
make test
make lint
make security-local
```

# CI Foreign Key Constraint Errors - Analysis and Solution

## Problem Summary

Integration tests were failing consistently in GitHub Actions CI with PostgreSQL foreign key constraint violations. The same tests passed reliably in local development environments using Docker Compose, indicating environment-specific timing or transaction management issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
Foreign key constraint violations were occurring in the following relationships:
- `port_scans.host_id` → `hosts.id` 
- `port_scans.job_id` → `scan_jobs.id`
- `scan_jobs.target_id` → `scan_targets.id`
- `services.port_scan_id` → `port_scans.id`

### Environment Differences

| Aspect | Local Development | GitHub Actions CI |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| **PostgreSQL Setup** | Docker Compose containers | Service containers |
| **Transaction Timing** | Predictable startup sequence | Parallel service initialization |
| **Isolation Level** | Default (Read Committed) | Default (Read Committed) |
| **Connection Pooling** | Stable timing | Variable timing |
| **Concurrent Access** | Single test runner | Potentially parallel operations |

### Specific Technical Issues

1. **Race Conditions in Host Creation**
   ```go
   // Problem: Host existence check and port scan creation were not atomic
   host := getOrCreateHost(ctx, db, ipAddr)  // Transaction 1
   // Gap here - host could be deleted by cleanup
   createPortScans(ctx, db, host.ID, scans)  // Transaction 2 - FK violation
   ```

2. **Insufficient Foreign Key Validation**
   ```go
   // Problem: No verification before creating dependent records
   portScan := &db.PortScan{
       HostID: hostID,  // Host might not exist
       JobID:  jobID,   // Job might not exist
   }
   repo.Create(ctx, portScan)  // FK constraint violation
   ```

3. **Transaction Isolation Issues**
   - CI environment had different timing for transaction commits
   - Default isolation level allowed phantom reads
   - Cleanup operations interfered with ongoing test operations

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Foreign Key Existence Verification

Added explicit verification before creating dependent records:

```go
// Before creating scan jobs
var targetExists bool
checkQuery := `SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM scan_targets WHERE id = $1)`
err := r.db.QueryRowContext(ctx, checkQuery, job.TargetID).Scan(&targetExists)
if !targetExists {
    return fmt.Errorf("scan target %s does not exist", job.TargetID)
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Transaction Management

#### Serializable Isolation for Critical Operations
```go
tx, err := r.db.BeginTxx(ctx, &sql.TxOptions{
    Isolation: sql.LevelSerializable,
})
```

#### Row-Level Locking for Consistency
```go
// Lock parent records to prevent deletion during child creation
verifyQuery := `SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM hosts WHERE id = $1) FOR UPDATE`
```

### 3. Improved Host Creation Safety

#### Atomic Host Operations
```go
func (r *HostRepository) CreateOrUpdate(ctx context.Context, host *Host) error {
    tx, err := r.db.BeginTxx(ctx, &sql.TxOptions{
        Isolation: sql.LevelReadCommitted,
    })
    // ... UPSERT logic within single transaction
    return tx.Commit()
}
```

#### Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
```go
const maxRetries = 5
const retryDelay = 200 * time.Millisecond

for attempt := 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++ {
    // ... operation logic
    if attempt < maxRetries {
        time.Sleep(retryDelay * time.Duration(attempt))
    }
}
```

### 4. Comprehensive Batch Operations

#### Pre-validation of All Foreign Keys
```go
func (r *PortScanRepository) CreateBatch(ctx context.Context, scans []*PortScan) error {
    // Verify all scan jobs exist
    for jobID := range jobIDs {
        var exists bool
        query := `SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM scan_jobs WHERE id = $1) FOR UPDATE`
        if !exists {
            return fmt.Errorf("scan job %s does not exist", jobID)
        }
    }
    
    // Verify all hosts exist
    for hostID := range hostIDs {
        var exists bool
        query := `SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM hosts WHERE id = $1) FOR UPDATE`
        if !exists {
            return fmt.Errorf("host %s does not exist", hostID)
        }
    }
    
    // Now safe to create port scans
}
```

### 5. CI-Specific Improvements

#### Enhanced Cleanup with Foreign Key Awareness
```go
func CleanupTestTables(ctx context.Context, database *db.DB) error {
    tables := []string{
        "host_history",   // depends on hosts, scan_jobs
        "services",       // depends on port_scans
        "port_scans",     // depends on scan_jobs, hosts
        "scan_jobs",      // depends on scan_targets
        "discovery_jobs", // no dependencies
        "hosts",          // no dependencies (referenced by others)
        "scan_targets",   // no dependencies (referenced by scan_jobs)
        "scheduled_jobs", // no dependencies
    }
    
    // Use deferred constraints for reliability
    _, err = tx.ExecContext(ctx, "SET CONSTRAINTS ALL DEFERRED")
}
```

#### Database Integrity Verification
```go
func VerifyDatabaseIntegrity(ctx context.Context, database *db.DB) error {
    checks := []struct {
        name  string
        query string
    }{
        {
            name: "orphaned port_scans (missing host)",
            query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM port_scans ps
                    LEFT JOIN hosts h ON ps.host_id = h.id
                    WHERE h.id IS NULL`,
        },
        // ... additional checks
    }
}
```

### 6. Enhanced Logging and Diagnostics

#### CI-Specific Logging
```go
if os.Getenv("GITHUB_ACTIONS") == "true" {
    fmt.Printf("CI: Database operation details...\n")
    fmt.Printf("CI: Found %d %s\n", count, description)
}
```

#### Transaction State Monitoring
```go
fmt.Printf("CI: Initial database state - hosts: %d, scan_jobs: %d, port_scans: %d",
    initialHosts, initialScanJobs, initialPortScans)
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Development Best Practices

- **Always verify foreign key existence** before creating dependent records
- **Use transactions for related operations** that must be atomic
- **Implement proper cleanup order** respecting foreign key dependencies
- **Add comprehensive logging** for CI environments

### 2. Testing Improvements

- **Run tests with CI-like conditions** locally using service containers
- **Add database integrity checks** as part of test setup/teardown
- **Test with concurrent operations** to identify race conditions
- **Use deterministic test data** to avoid timing-dependent failures

### 3. Database Design Considerations

- **Consider using CASCADE deletes** where appropriate for cleanup
- **Add database-level constraints** with meaningful error messages
- **Use proper indexing** on foreign key columns for performance
- **Consider using database triggers** for audit trails

### 4. CI Configuration

- **Use explicit wait conditions** for service containers
- **Add health checks** for all dependent services
- **Configure appropriate timeouts** for database operations
- **Use consistent PostgreSQL versions** between environments

## Verification

### Test Results
All integration tests now pass consistently in both local and CI environments:

```bash
$ go test ./test -v -timeout 120s
=== RUN   TestScanWithDatabaseStorage
--- PASS: TestScanWithDatabaseStorage (2.25s)
=== RUN   TestDiscoveryWithDatabaseStorage  
--- PASS: TestDiscoveryWithDatabaseStorage (0.31s)

---

## Migration Overview

### Problem Statement
The original CLI implementation suffered from several critical issues:
- **Schedule command parsing failures** due to manual argument handling
- **Poor user experience** with basic help text and error messages
- **Maintenance burden** with 1000+ line monolithic main.go
- **No shell completion** or modern CLI features
- **Limited configuration options** beyond basic YAML files

### Solution Approach
Complete migration to **Cobra** (CLI framework) and **Viper** (configuration management):
- Replace manual parsing with robust command structure
- Add comprehensive help and validation
- Enable shell completion and environment variable support
- Create modular, maintainable command architecture

## Benefits and Improvements

### 1. User Experience Enhancements

#### Rich Help and Documentation
- **Comprehensive help** for every command and flag
- **Usage examples** showing real-world scenarios
- **Automatic validation** with clear error messages
- **Shell completion** for bash/zsh (tab completion)

#### Better Error Handling
```bash
# Before: Cryptic manual parsing errors
Error: not enough arguments

# After: Clear, actionable error messages
Error: either --targets or --live-hosts must be specified

See 'scanorama scan --help' for usage examples.
```

### 2. Configuration Management Improvements

#### Environment Variable Support
```bash
# Automatic environment variable binding
export SCANORAMA_DATABASE_HOST=production-db
export SCANORAMA_SCANNING_WORKER_POOL_SIZE=20
export SCANORAMA_VERBOSE=true

./scanorama discover 10.0.0.0/8  # Uses env vars automatically
```

#### Multiple Configuration Formats
- YAML (existing)
- JSON support
- Environment variables
- Command-line flag overrides
- Configuration file watching

### 3. Developer Experience

#### Maintainable Code Structure
- **Modular commands** - Each command in its own file
- **Consistent patterns** - Standardized database setup and error handling
- **Easy to extend** - Adding new commands is trivial
- **Better testing** - Commands can be tested in isolation

#### Example: Adding a New Command
```go
// Before: Add to 950-line switch statement + manual parsing
// After: Simple new file
var newCmd = &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "new-feature",
    Short: "Description of new feature",
    Run:   runNewFeature,
}

func init() {
    rootCmd.AddCommand(newCmd)
    newCmd.Flags().StringVar(&flag, "flag", "", "Flag description")
}
```

### 4. Professional CLI Features

#### Shell Completion
```bash
# Generate completion scripts
./scanorama completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/scanorama
./scanorama completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_scanorama

# Tab completion now works
./scanorama sc<TAB>    → scan schedule
./scanorama scan --<TAB> → shows all available flags
```

#### Flag Validation and Relationships
```go
// Automatic mutual exclusion
scanCmd.MarkFlagsMutuallyExclusive("targets", "live-hosts")

// Required flags
profilesTestCmd.MarkFlagRequired("target")

// Automatic argument count validation
Args: cobra.ExactArgs(3),  // Requires exactly 3 arguments
```

- **API compatibility** - Internal packages unchanged
- **Database compatibility** - No database schema changes

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Linting Issues (Non-Critical)
The migration introduced several linting warnings that need cleanup:
- **Error handling**: Some `defer database.Close()` calls need error checking
- **Code duplication**: Some database setup code could be extracted
- **Line length**: Some lines exceed 120 character limit
- **Magic numbers**: Some constants should be defined

**Impact**: Low - these are code quality issues, not functional problems  
**Priority**: Medium - should be addressed in follow-up PR

### 2. Incomplete Integration (Expected)
Some CLI commands show placeholder messages:
```bash
# Example output
Discovery functionality not yet fully implemented with new CLI
Network: 192.168.1.0/24, Method: tcp, DetectOS: false
```

**Impact**: Low - this was expected during migration  
**Priority**: High - next phase will wire up full functionality

### 3. Advanced Features Pending
- **Shell completion scripts** need to be generated and packaged
- **Configuration validation** could be more comprehensive
- **Plugin system** foundation exists but not implemented
